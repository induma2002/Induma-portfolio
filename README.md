Personal portfolio site for Induma Wijesinghe showcasing backend-focused full-stack skills, signature projects, and contact information.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for semantic structure
- Modern CSS with custom properties and responsive layout
- Lightweight JavaScript for interactive behavior

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and open the project folder.
2. Use a local web server (for example `npx live-server` or the VS Code Live Server extension) to serve `index.html`.
3. Visit `http://localhost:8080` (or the port your server reports) in the browser.

## Customization Tips
- Update copy and metrics directly in `index.html`.
- Swap hero and project assets inside the `assets/` directory.
